## Pre-submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to get feedback in advance to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student's work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged and pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous. Details will be forthcming. 

Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by **January 15, 2018**, using the [Softconf submission system](https://www.softconf.com/naacl2018/naacl2018-SRW).

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within 4 weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.

## Mentoring of Accepted Papers

There will also be mentors who provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions for the workshop presentation.
